# Set up an open source project

**GROUP ASSIGNMENT**

**How to submit**: GitHub project set up and submission to BBLearn with (i) a screenshot of your README and (ii) you license_justification.md file

**Deadline:** March 2, 2023 - 11:59 PM

#### Your project
You are expected to create an open source project. You can simply imagine something (a product you would implement or that you idealize), describing how it is or how it would be; or you can select any project that a member of the group produced (*e.g.* as an assignment for other course, as a toy project, etc.). By following the information presented on opensource.guide [1, 2], make your project an Open Source project. Make sure to create a good page, providing meaningful and complete documentation, and analyzing the items cited by the references aforementioned. 

* Your project needs to be the one that your group created under  NAU-OSS organization (https://github.com/NAU-OSS). Change the name if you prefer.

You will be evaluated taking into consideration how adherent you project is with what is presented by the opensource.guide. The content of the pages created will be evaluated as essays. 

#### Your license
Your group will have to decide what would be the license you will apply to the project you just open-sourced. You can follow the simple site [https://choosealicense.com/], use [Chapter 2 of Fogel's book](https://producingoss.com/en/license-quickstart.html) or take a look at Andrew St. Laurent's book ([Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing](https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/osfreesoft/book/index.html)).

You will have to create a file called ``license_justification.md`` containing a paragraph that justifies your choice.
