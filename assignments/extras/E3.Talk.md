## Attend a talk and write a summary 

For this one you can attend any talk that is related to CS at CEIAS and write a summary. Visitor talks, job talks, PhD defenses, all count. 
Please stay tuned to announcements coming from SICCS, CEIAS, or any faculty member. Our own invited lectures do not count!

This needs to be done by Apr 30. 

**Deliverable:** a short summary of the talk 1-2 paragraphs. Your paper should contain the name of the presenter and the title of the presentation. Please turn it in on BBLearn
