## Summary: 
Writing parallelized finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation code, such as that used in waveform simulations, is often customized for the specific hardware the simulation is run on. This results in complex and unportable code. Stoltzfus et al. designed a three-layer system to produce hardware-specific, optimized parallel code from a high-level, portable language. The system was shown to produce comparable results to hand-optimized code in a stencil application accurately simulating room accousics.
