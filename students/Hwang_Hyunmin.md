The paper discusses how past glacial conditions provide insights into future increases in extreme El Niño events. Researchers used simulations based on palaeoclimate data, showing that warming due to greenhouse gases may weaken ocean-atmosphere interactions. This change could lead to more frequent and severe El Niño events, which have significant implications for global weather patterns, such as extreme weather events and disruptions in ecosystems. The study highlights the importance of understanding historical climate changes to predict future climatic impacts.
