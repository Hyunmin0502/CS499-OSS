# The Cathedral and the Bazaar
## Report
> Eric Raymond's essay "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" was an interesting dive into the open source world and how that particular coding style rocked 
> the technical world. In particular, Raymond admits that his early development style better resembles a "cathedral": this cathedral is carefully, meticulously 
> crafted and built by "skilled mages and wizards" that are specifically picked to fulfill their role and help build the cathedral from the ground up.
> In comes Linus Torvalds and his open source project Linux. The Linux approach was much different than the cathedral approach, Raymond dubs this the "bazaar": the
> bazaar is a bustling, lively amalgamation of many different entities and heads all trying to contribute. Despite the expected chaos, a powerful project
> is created by thousands of people together through the open source "bazaar" development method.
